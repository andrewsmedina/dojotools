Dojotools is intended to help in coding dojo sessions.


Our *huge* feature list is:

 - Watch a directory for changes and run a user supplied command
   when a file changes

 - Keep track of the round time (in the simplest way possible)


The only dependency is pygtk (to create the status icon), but if
you want notifications, you should also have pynotify installed.

Notifications, will not work very well in Ubuntu, since Canonicalâ€™s
Notify-OSD does not behave the same way as libnotify does in other
linux distributions.

You can revert to the old notification-daemon following instructions
in [this Ubuntu forums post][1] by [gradinaruvasile][2]:

We still need notifications for other platforms.

Another optional dependency is [python-firmata][python-firmata] if you
want to use an Arduino to show the status of your tests using a [real,
physical semaphore][semaphore].

If you want to do so, install [python-firmata][python-firmata], upload the firmata
sketch to your Arduino, and leave it connected to your usb port.

Because of the way we initiate the communication with the Arduino,
this will probably not work on Windows for now.
